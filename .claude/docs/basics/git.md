# Git workflow

When working with this project:

- Commit message format: Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Branch naming: Use descriptive names like fix/issue-name or feat/feature-name
- Pull requests: Target the main branch with clear descriptions

- when you create a git commit, keep the commit as tiny as possible and git message as detailed as possible. However each commits should be meaningful and not just a single line change. you can use git hunk to selectively commit changes.
- IMPORTANT: Do not push to main branch directly without permission. You need to consider creating a new branch for your changes and then create a PR to merge it into main branch.
